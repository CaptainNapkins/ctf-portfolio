This is a overview of John Hammond's solve of Everyday I'm Buffering challenge from RCTF 

1.) Analyzing the Binary
	- Use "readelf -s -p <program>" to look for the symbols in the binary
		- Can see there is a "secretfunction" within the binary

	- Can crash the program with a lot of input and get a seg fault
		- Runs dmseg to see where the segfault has occured, and can see we have overwritten the return address

	- Guess and check to find the offset 
		- Can see that the offset is 32 bytes


2.) Exploitation
	- First, found the address of the secret function

	- Then, craft a payload and send an offset of 32 A's followed by the address of the secret funciton in little endian

	- These returns us to our secret function and prints the flag!
