## An overview of solved CTF challenges and lessons learned

This contains a collection of practice CTF challenges that have been solved along with lessons learned 
along the way. There are also notes taken from videos and blogs about certain challenge types and exploitation methods. This will also act as a central place of everything that has been learned so far in the pwn CTF category. Understanding the challenge and the reasoning behind the solve is equally important as obtaining
a solve in the first place.
