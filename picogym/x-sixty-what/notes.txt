The payload did not work when trying to return to the flag function locally. However, when running the payload
through gdb and insepcting it, the flag was in the stack it just had not printed to stdout. The base address of the
flag function, which happend to be the endbr64 instruction, was used.  

So, **NOTE: Even if a payload should work and doesn't, test it in GDB

The endbr64 instruction in the flag function was likely the problem, and the third address in the flag function worked
both locally and remotly for the exploit. 

DOUBLE CHECK STUFF IN GDB IF UNSURE
