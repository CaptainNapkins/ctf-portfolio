1.) 32 bit, NX diabled, no pie, no canary aka paradise
	- nc saturn.picoctf.net 53499


2.) Open up source and notice there is a vuln and a win funciton. 
	- Looking at the win function it appears to opena  file called 
	flag.txt when called. 
	- So, the goal should be trying to return to the win function
	- The vuln function defines a buffer size and uses the vulnerable
	gets function. The buffer size is also at the top as 32
	- The program also prints the return address, which is a clue that 
	we will need to overflow the buffer and point to the return address
	of the win function

3.) Need to find addresses and ensure the buffer size is 32 with gdb 
	- win @ 0x080491f6
	- main @ 0x080492c4
	- using cyclic, buffer size is 41
	- CORRECTION, buffer size appears to be 44 when debugging manually
4.) Write pwntools script
